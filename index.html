                Web 3 is an idea for a new iteration of 
                the World Wide Web which incorporates concepts 
                such as decentralization, in the form of a distributed 
                ledger such as blockchain technologies, and token-based
                 economics. Implementing heterogenous computing that enables parallel computing amongst different types of devices.
                 By integrating web 3 and heterogenous computing along with WebGL, we can achieve a simulated experience called virtual reality.
